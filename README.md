# üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant tips analysis
## A brief description of what your project does
This project aims to use the restaurant tips dataset to practice creating composition plots and visualizations. We will examine the relationship between different variables and the tips given.

## A description of the data it uses, including
The dataset consists of information from 244 restaurant bills, collected in the US in 1987.

It includes details about the tips given to restaurant staff, such as the total bill, tip amount, gender of the person paying, smoking status, day of the week, time of day, and party size.

## The main goals
Analyze and find out the customers' habits when they give tips as well as the amount of tips given based on:
- Smokers or non-smokers.
- Gender male or female.
- Weekend or weekday.
- Dinner or lunch time at the restaurant.
## Results
In general, customers who come to eat at this restaurant have the habit of tipping and the most tips given range from 2 USD to 4 USD. Men, non-smokers, people who come to the restaurant for dinner on weekends tend to tip more than women and smokers. For more details, you can refer to the file *.ipynb I uploaded.
